To implement this solver, please 

[1] run startup.m first to add the path;

[2] run demonXXXX.m to solve different problems

This source code is programmed based on the algorithm described in:

S.Zhou, Sparse SVM for Sufficient Data Reduction, [arXiv:2005.13771](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13771), 2020

Please give credits to this paper if you use the code for your research.
